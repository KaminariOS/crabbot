You can find the source code of happy(~/repos/happy) and codex(~/repos/codex) locally. Pull the latest every time you start working. Use the happy and codex codebase as references on demand.
This project uses a Nix flake to set up the development environment.

Stop and ask me if you need some external set up like database.

For codex TUI, just copy the logic from Codex. Do not implement your own without referencing Codex source.
